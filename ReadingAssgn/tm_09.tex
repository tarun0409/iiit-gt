\begin{frame}{Generalizing Robert's Theorem}
In words, weak monotonicity in a parallel domain means that if alternative a is selected under $(u_{i},u_{-i})$ and alternative b is selected under $(u_{i}^{'},u_{-i})$, the additional willingness to pay for $b$ comparing with
$a$ according to $u_{i}^{'}$, i.e. $p_{i,b}^{'}-p_{i,a}^{'}$, must be at least as big as the additional willingness to pay for $b$ comparing with a according to $u:p_{i,b}^{'}-p_{i,a}^{'}$.
