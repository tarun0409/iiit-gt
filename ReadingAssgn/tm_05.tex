\begin{itemize}
    \item Since $a_{-i}^{*}$ is the maximizer of $\sum _{j \neq i}k_{j}p_{j,a} + C_{a}$, all agent-independent prices are non-negative.
    \item Moreover, $a_{-i}^{*}$ has the minimum price among all alternatives, which is exactly zero: $min_{a \in A}\{t_{i,a}(u_{-i})\} = t_{i,a_{-i}^{*}}(u_{-i})=0$.
    \item By Lemma 1, we know that if it is DSIC, the prices are standard, and the mechanism satisfies IR and No subsidy.
    \item To prove: Choosing $a^{*}$ at such agent-independent prices is agent-maximizing for all agents, which implies DSIC.
    \item From Lemma 2 we know that we only need to prove $a^{*}$ is the maximizer of $p_{i,a}-t_{i,a}(u_{-i})$ for all agents. This is immediate for agents with $k_{i}=0$.
